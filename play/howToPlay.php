		<span>CREATING A TEAM</span>
		<li>You can create your team by giving it an awesome name and an inspiring motto. Then choose a beautiful theme from the various theme options that we have given you. You can also upload your profile picture so that your friends can recognize you.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<span>SELECTING AN XI</span>
		<li>For Tournament Mode and Match Mode, you have 1 million Credits to build a squad of 11 players. Each player has been assigned roles (batsman, all rounder, wicket keeper, bowler), and a price (ranging from 60,000 Credits to 110,000 Credits). Players are priced based on their overall ODI record, experience and form. Care has been taken to provide a wide range of prices for each team, so that users can create valid squads for each match.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<span>WINNING</span>
		<li>In the Tournament Mode, the team with the most points wins. Credits spent don't matter. Subs used don’t matter. It’s just the points. However, in case of a tie, the total points earned by all the Power Players of the teams will be compared. The team whose Power Players earned more points wins. In the extremely unlikely event of a tie in the Power Player points as well, the winning team will be decided by the ICC.</li>

		<li>In the Match Mode, it is again only the points that count. However, in case of a tie, the team that was finalized earlier wins.</li>

		<li>All prize winners will be notified by email, with instructions on how to claim their prizes.</li>
